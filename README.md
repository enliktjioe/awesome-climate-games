# awesome-climate-games
**Welcome to Our Awesome Climate Games** :earth_africa: :video_game:

We’re two friends who met through *Work on Climate* organization, connecting from opposite sides of the world—one in China, venturing into the game industry as a 3D environment artist after a career in mechanical engineering, and the other in Germany, exploring the intersection between game development and climate science, while spending most of his career in backend game programming and data engineering.

Despite our unique career paths, we share a common goal: using the power of games to make a positive impact on climate and the environment. This page is our way of sharing the tools, insights, and resources we discover on our journey. Whether you’re new to climate games or already involved, we hope you’ll find something valuable here. 

We are wide open to [contributions](https://github.com/enliktjioe/awesome-climate-games/blob/master/contribution.md) of course! Don't hesitate to add your awesome resources related tp climate games by making a [pull request].
